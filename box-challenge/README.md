# Challenge

You are given a box with integer dimensions length x width x height. You also have a set of cubes whose sides are powers of 2, e.g. 1x1x1, 2x2x2, 4x4x4 etc.

You need to fill the box with cubes from the set.

Write a program that for a given box and given set of cubes can determine the smallest number of cubes needed to fill the box.

The set of cubes can be represented for instance as a list or array of numbers, where the position in the list designates the dimension of the cube. E.g. 100 10 1 means you have 100 cubes of 1x1x1 and 10 cubes of 2x2x2 and 1 cube of 4x4x4.

A problem specification is a sequence of lines separated by newline. Each line has the box dimensions as the first three elements and the remaining elements enumerate the given cubes. Elements are separated by a single space. Lines are terminated by your platform's newline convention. E.g.

2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 1 2 3 4

specifies two problems:
a box with dimensions 2 x 3 x 4, 5 cubes of 1x1x1 and 6 cubes of 2x2x2
a box with dimensions 7 x 8 x 9, 1 cube of 1x1x1, 2 of 2x2x2, 3 of 4x4x4, and 4 of 8x8x8.

Your program should read one or more problem specifications from stdin and print the answer to each problem on stdout. Spend as little effort as possible on parsing and validation of the input. An unsolvable problem should yield -1. Please provide instructions on how to run / compile your program.

Examples:
Assume the file 'problems.txt' contains:

10    10    10    2000
10    10    10    900
4     4     8     10    10  1
5     5     5     61    7   1
5     5     6     61    4   1
1000  1000  1000  0     0   0  46501  0  2791  631  127  19  1
1     1     9     9     1

Then executing

./myprogram < problems.txt

should print the following to stdout:
1000
-1
9
62
59
50070
9
